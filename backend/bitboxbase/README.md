# BitBox Base Integration

The code in this directory contains the logic needed for integration of the desktop app with the BitBox Base. There are two ways to connect with a BitBox Base.
- By connecting directly with an ip
- By mdns

The package mdns implements these two connection variants. Both variants attempt a connection with the `TryMakeNewBase` function, given an ip. `TryMakeNewBase` will attempt to create a new `BitBoxBase` instance with `NewBitBoxBase`, given a valid ip. `NewBitBoxBase` calls the `Connect` function from the updater package. Here, the connection is first checked with an initial get request. Subsequently a websocket connection is spawned in a separate goroutine that emits events when receiving data.

To orchestrate everything, the backend keeps a map of connected BitBox Bases, by mapping from a unique ID assigned to each Base on connection and their instantiation. It also creates a `NewDetector` and gives it function callbacks to register and deregiste BitBox Bases. This detector instance listens for new BitBox Bases on the local network indefinitely, when a new one is found, it calls `TryMakeNewBase`, and the passed in register callback. The callback then triggers an event letting the frontend know that a new BitBox Base is registered. The frontend then gets all the registered BitBox Bases's IDs and starts listening for events. The callback also subscribes the backend to any events that the websocket connection with the Base emits and passes these to the websocket in the handlers package.

The handler also exposes an http POST endpoint that allows for direct connection with the base. For this, it passes an ip to the backend's detector instance that then subsequently calls `TryMakeNewBase`.
